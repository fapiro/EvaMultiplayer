This project is EvaMultiplayer Client example which uses:
 * EvaArchitecture (see UnityAssetStore)
 * Eva Multiplayer Backend Servers (JetaCore Cloud) 
   (benefits: fix payments for rent, not for multiplayer traffic)
Project does not contain any graphics or physics. 
It contains multiplayer client logic which helps:
+) Receive and send Multiplayer Data
+) Draw other players and their bots/enemies
+) Handle player disconnection during battle and switch bots to another players

EvaArchitecture is used for SOLID, MVVM purposes.
